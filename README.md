# Group-wise overlay of scatterplot combined with marginal distribution on the sides using Stata

The visual makes use of a dataset from ggplot2 by the name of 'mpg.csv'.

Using Stata I make an attempt to create a concise code that can allow for visualizing all elements using Tableau Colors.

The Scheme is is 'white_tableau' taken from Asjad Naqvi's Schemepack (ssc install schemepack, replace)
